- Description: This project is a group project, which conducts a sentimental analysis on the ChatGPT comments on Reddit using R. We concerns three questions: 
	(1) How does public attitude toward ChatGPT evolve over time? (Sentiment analysis)
	(2) What are the usersâ€™ primary concerns with ChatGPT? (Topic modeling)
	(3) What awaits human beings as the AI revolution unfolds?
